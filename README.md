## Summary
***This is not a list of ressources to learn how to trade or make money with cryptocurrencies.***

This document has the objectif centralize ressources and making a global path for people interested in the blockchain development and its ecosystem.

### Prerequisites
I think it's important that the blockchain technology should be accessible. That is why, I try as good as I can to add some general ressources about the blockchain. However, the main purpose is to understand how to interact with the blockchain and build apps using the blockchain so you need to have some knowledge about development. 

### Participate
I started this document to keep track of the ressources that I use to teach myself what the blockchain is and how I can learn new skills about the blockchain development. If you find some parts or this document irrelevant, incomplete or depreciated, please feel free to comment and participate. You can contact me on my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/AlexLab71).
Moreover, english is not my main language so feel free to correct me !
